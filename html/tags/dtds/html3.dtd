        Document Type Definition for the HyperText Markup Language (HTML DTD)

        Draft: Fri 24-Mar-95 09:46:33

        Author: Dave Raggett <dsr@hplb.hpl.hp.com>

        W3O is developing a testbed browser to provide practical
        experience with HTML 3.0 before it becomes a standard.
        See:  http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Arena/

        This is an open process and comments are welcomed on the
        www-html mailing list.

        Please use the following MIME content type:
        
        	Content-Type: text/html; version=3.0
        	
        This will allow clients to distinguish HTML 3.0 from current
        HTML documents. This is most easily achieved by saving
        files with the extension ".html3" or ".ht3" so that servers
        can easily distinguish these files from HTML 2.0 files.
        
        The entity HTML.Recommended can be used to give a more rigorous
        version of the DTD suitable for use with SGML authoring tools.
        The default version of the DTD offers a laxer interpretation,
        e.g. allowing authors to omit leading <P> elements. You can
        switch on the more rigorous version of the DTD by including
        the following at the start of your HTML document.

         <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 3.0//EN//"
            [ <!ENTITY % HTML.Recommended "INCLUDE"> ] >


        Design Objectives:

        o   Backwards compatibility with 2.0

        o   Tightening up HTML.Recommended and
            moving more things to HTML.Deprecated

        o   Keep HTML - simple don't compete with CALS

        o   Make it practical for people to edit HTML 3.0
            documents directly, i.e. avoid long names.

        o   Tables, figures and math from HTML+
            with tweaks based on recent experience

        o   Client-side event handling for figures
            and graphical form selection menus

        o   Add limited presentational controls with
            a view to use of linked style sheets
            (style overrides are supported)

        o   Compatibility with ICADD as per Yuri's suggestions

        HTML 3.0 relies on linked style info to give authors
        control over the appearence of documents. Such info is
        placed in a linked style sheet, or as overrides in the
        HTML document head, using the STYLE element. The generic
        CLASS attribute can be used to subclass elements when
        you want to use a different style from normal, e.g. you
        might use <h2 class=bigcaps> for headers with enlarged
        capital letters. Note that the class attribute has a
        wider scope than just style changes, e.g. browsers could
        provide the means for searching through documents,
        restricting search according to element class values.

        The DTD contains a small number of attributes for direct
        control of basic alignment parameters; column widths for
        tables; support for custom bullets, sequence numbering for
        lists and headers; and text flow. These attributes offer
        control over appearence which would be inconvenient to
        express exclusively via associated style sheets.

        The MD attribute for each hypertext or inline link specifies a
        message digest such as MD5 for the linked object and is needed
        to ensure someone hasn't tampered with a linked document.

       the top left corner of the associated image.

       The attribute value is a string taking one of the following forms:
       
       		"default"
       		
       Used to define a default link for the figure background.

            "circle x, y, r" 

       (x, y) define the center and r the radius.

            "rect x, y, w, h"

       (x, y) defines upper left, and w and h the width and height.

            "polygon x1, y1, x2, y2, ..."

       Given n pairs of x, y coordinates, the polygon is closed by a
       line linking the n'th point to the first. Intersecting polygons
       use the non-zero winding number rule to determine if a point lies
       inside the polygon.I

<!-- SGML standard forces different NAMES for all attribute values
     in the same element, regardless of the attribute name! As a result

<!--
When text flows around a figure or table in the margin, you sometimes want
to start an element like a header, paragraph or list below the figure rather
than alongside it. The CLEAR attribute allows you to move down unconditionally:

	clear=left          move down until left margin is clear
	clear=right         move down until right margin is clear
	clear=all           move down until both margins are clear

Alternatively, you can decide to place the element alongside the figure just
so long as there is enough room. The minimum width needed is specified as:

	clear="40 en"       move down until there is at least 40 en units free
	clear="100 pixels"  move down until there is at least 100 pixels free
	
The style sheet (or browser defaults) may provide default minimum widths for
each class of block-like elements.

  Headers can be numbered, although this is a matter for style sheets.
  The style sheet controls the numbering style:

     a) whether the parent numbering is inherited, e.g.  5.i.c
        where 5 is the current sequence number for H1 headers, and
        1 is the number for H2 headers and 3 for H3 headers.

     b) what style is used for current sequence number
        e.g. arabic, upperalpha, loweralpha, upperroman, lowerroman
        or a numbering scheme appropriate for the current language

  The skip attribute is used to skip over sequence numbers for items
  which have been left out of the list, e.g. skip=3 advances the
  sequence number past 3 omitted items. The seqnum sets the sequence
  number to a specified value. Note that the style sheet may take
  advantage of the sequence number for higher level headers.

  The dingbat or src attributes may be used to specify a bullet like
  image to be placed adjacent to the header. Defining this in the
  header element simplifies the document markup and avoids the need
  to use the clear or needs attribute in the following element to
  prevent it flowing around this image.

    Tables and figures can be aligned in several ways:

    bleedleft   flush left with the left (window) border
    left        flush left with the left text margin
    center      centered (text flow is disabled for this mode)
    right       flush right with the right text margin
    bleedright  flush right with the right (window) border
    justify     when applicable the table/figure should stretch
                to fill space between the text margins

    Note: text will flow around the table or figure if the browser
    judges there is enough room and the alignment is not centered
    or justified. The table or figure may itself be part of the
    text flow around some earlier figure. You can in this case use
    the clear or needs attributes to move the new table or figure
    down the page beyond the obstructing earlier figure. Similarly,
    you can use the clear or needs attributes with other elements
    such as headers and lists to move them further down the page.
-->

<!ENTITY % block.align

<!--
    The HTML 3.0 table model has been chosen for its simplicity
    and the ease in writing filters from common DTP packages.

    By default the table is automatically sized according to the
    cell contents and the current window size. Specifying the columns
    widths using the colspec attribute allows browsers to start
    displaying the table without having to wait for last row.

    The colspec attribute is a list of column widths and alignment
    specifications. The columns are listed from left to right with
    a capital letter followed by a number, e.g. COLSPEC="L20 C8 L40".
    The letter is L for left, C for center, R for right alignment of
    cell contents. J is for justification, when feasible, otherwise
    this is treated in the same way as L for left alignment.
    Column entries are delimited by one or more space characters.
    
    The number specifies the width in en's, pixels or as a
    fractional value of the table width, as according to the
    associated units attribute. This approach is more compact
    than used with most SGML table models and chosen to simplify
    hand entry. The width attribute allows you to specify the
    width of the table in pixels, en units or as a percentage
    of the space between the current left and right margins.

    To assist with rendering to speech, row and column headers
    can be given short names using the AXIS attribute. The AXES
    attribute is used to explicitly specify the row and column
    names for use with each cell. Otherwise browsers can follow
    up columns and left along rows (right for some languages)
    to find the corresponding header cells.

    Table content model: Braille limits the width of tables,
    placing severe limits on column widths. User agents need
    to render big cells by moving the content to a note placed
    before the table. The cell is then rendered as a link to
    the corresponding note.

    To assist with formatting tables to paged media, authors
    can differentiate leading and trailing rows that are to
    be duplicated when splitting tables across page boundaries.
    The recommended way is to subclass rows with the CLASS attribute
    For example: <TR CLASS=Header>, <TR CLASS=Footer> are used for
    header and footer rows. Paged browsers insert footer rows at
    the bottom of the current page and header rows at the top of
    the new page, followed by the remaining body rows.

    Browsers should tolerate an omission of the first <TR>
    tag as it is implied by the context. Missing trailing
    <TR>s implied by rowspans should be ignored.

    The alignment attributes act as defaults for rows
    overriding the colspec attribute and being in turn
    overridden by alignment attributes on cell elements.
    Use valign=baseline when you want to ensure that text
    in different cells on the same row is aligned on the

                                 c - d

     The delimiters are represented using the LEFT and RIGHT
     elements as in:

     {[<LEFT>x + y<RIGHT>]}   is   [ x + y ]
     {(<LEFT>a<RIGHT>]}       is   (a]
     {||<LEFT>a<RIGHT>||}     is   || a ||

     Use &lbrace; and &rbrace; for "{" and "}" respectively as
     these symbols are used as shorthand for BOX, e.g.

     {&lbrace;<LEFT>a+b<RIGHT>&rbrace;}  is  {a+b}

     You can stretch definite integrals to match the integrand, e.g.

     {&int;<SUB>a</SUB><SUP>b</SUP><LEFT>{f(x)<over>1+x} dx}

            b
            /  f(x)
            | ----- dx
            / 1 + x
            a

     Note the complex content model for BOX is a work around
     for the absence of support for infix operators in SGML.

     You can get oversize delimiters with the SIZE attribute,
     for example <BOX SIZE=large>(<LEFT>...<RIGHT>)</BOX>

     Note that the names of common functions are recognized
     by the parser without the need to use "&" and ";" around
     them, e.g. int, sum, sin, cos, tan, ...

<!-- LaTeX like arrays. The COLDEF attribute specifies
     a single capital letter for each column determining
     how the column should be aligned, e.g. coldef="CCC"

        "L"     left
        "C"     center
        "R"     right
        
     An optional separator letter can occur between columns
     and should be one of + - or =, e.g. "C+C+C+C=C".
     Whitespace within coldef is ignored. By default, the
     columns are all centered.
     
     The ALIGN attribute alters the vertical position of the
     array as compared with preceding and following expressions.

     Use LDELIM and RDELIM attributes for delimiter entities.
     When the LABELS attribute is present, the array is
     displayed with the first row and the first column as
     labels displaced from the other elements. In this case,
     the first element of the first row should normally be
     left blank.

     Use &vdots; &cdots; and &ddots; for vertical, horizontal
     and diagonal ellipsis dots. Use &dotfill; to fill an array
     cell with horizontal dots (e.g. for a full row).
     Note &ldots; places the dots on the baseline, while &cdots;
     places them higher up.
